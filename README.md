## Admeta & Mina zero-knowledge proof 

### Introduction
In the Web3 world, advertising is also a very important part. Admeta is an advertising platform that focuses on Web3. Through this project, after the user authorizes the browser to access the white list, we endow the user with a soul label by analyzing the user's behavior , with this label, users can be accurately placed with advertisements and get rewards after completing the advertisements.

### Use Mina
For user privacy data, we use Mina's zero-knowledge proof to achieve the purpose of safely protecting user data.

### Case Explanation
1. When a user visits a domain name in the whitelist, such as uniswap.com, we provide Chrome Extension for analysis and label the user as SWAP.
2. Every certain period, such as once a day, analyze data, and count the top three tags of user behavior as soul behavior.
3. Accurately place advertisements through the user's soul behavior.

### Future plan
We will be the largest advertising platform in the Web3 world.
1. Push accurate advertisements to users
2. Verify that the user completes the ad task
3. User gets rewarded
