## AdMeta & Mina zero-knowledge proof 
This is the AdMeta demo project with ZK implementation on Mina Blockchain.

### Introduction
Online advertising is in greater demand than ever before. AdmMta is an advertising platform that focuses on Web3. 

In this project, users can first authorize AdMeta Extension to track the browsing time of whitelisted websites, and thereafter users will be entitled with corresponding soul labels out of analysis of their browsing behaviors. With these labels, users can be accurately targeted with advertisements and claim rewards after completing the advertisement tasks.

### Use Mina
For user privacy data, we use Mina's zero-knowledge proof to achieve the purpose of safely protecting user data.

### Case Explanation
1. When a user visits a domain name in the whitelist, such as uniswap.com, we provide Chrome Extension for analysis and label the user as SWAP.
2. Every certain period, such as once a day, analyze data, and count the top three tags of user behavior as soul behavior.
3. Accurately place advertisements through the user's soul behavior.
